Hello, to begin, I went to New York Times graphs to find a graph to emulate, and immediately I was faced with a large and very detailed election map. I ended up choosing that as my first graph. 
The graph shows each county in each state, and shows the margins for that county and the state in general. Democrat states are blue and republican states are red, by county. I think this graph is important due to the election being a really important time in everyones lives as a democracy, where half the population literally votes as well.
I really like graph because its not one of the conventional graphs you see all the time like a bar graph or scatter plot, but its unique to the United States and important to millions in the country. I like the idea of having states as borders. In this graph, some marks would be the literal borders of the shape, or the geoshape, as well as possibly the text pertaining to and annotating each state.
Some channels are color for the party as well as opacity for the margins.
